        <li>Assume that your neighbour is looking for new place to live in. he wants to live in a quite place, has less than 100 people and is not an island.</li>
        <li>write an if statement to help your neighbour figure out if ikorodu is right for her. you will need to write a condition that accounts for all neigbour's criteria</li>
        <li>if ikorodu is the right country. log a string like this: 'you should live in Ikorodu'. if not 'Ikorodu does not meet your criteria'</li>

    <h3><center>coding challenge</center></h3>
    <ul>
        <p>there are two gymnastics teams, <b>Bias</b> and <b>Jordan</b>. they compete against each other 3 times. the winner with the highest average score wins a trophy</p>
        <li>calculate the average score for each team, using the test data below</li>
        <li>compare the team's average scores to determine the winner of the competition, and print it to the console. don't forget that there can be draw. so test for that as well (draw means they have the same average score)</li>
        <li><b>bonus 1:</b> include a requirement for a minimum score of 100. with this rule, a team only wins if it has a higher score than the other team, and the same time a score of at least 100 points. <b>hint:</b> use a logical operator to test for minimum score, as well as multiple else-if blocks</li>
        <li><b>bonus 2:</b>Minimum score also applies to a draw! so a draw only happens when both teams have the same score and both have a score greater or equal 100 points. otherwise. no team wins the trophy</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>test data</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><b>data 1:</b> Bias score 96, 108 and 89. Jordan score 88, 91, 110</li>
        <li><b>data bonus 2:</b>bias score 97, 112 and 101. Jordan score 109, 95 and 123</li>
        <li><b>data bonus 2: </b> bias score 97, 112, and 101. Jordan score 109, 95 and 106</li>
