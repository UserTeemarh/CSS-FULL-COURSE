    <h1><center>INTRODUCTION TO JAVASCRIPT</center></h1>
    <p>Javascripts is high level, object-oriented, multi paradigm programming language. more expantiatively it can defined as programming language used for creating or adding functionality to websites</p>
    <p>JavaScript is a lightweight programming language commonly used by web developers to add dynamic interactions to web pages, applications, servers, and even games.</p>
    <p><mark>It works seamlessly alongside HTML and CSS, complementing CSS in formatting HTML elements while providing user interaction, a capability that CSS alone lacks.</mark></p>
    <p><i>JavaScriptâ€™s widespread applications in web, mobile app, and game development make it a valuable language to learn.</i></p>
   <h2>Method of Linking JavaScript to HTML:</h2>
   <ul>
    <li>Internal Script</li>
    <li>External Script</li>
   </ul>
    <h3><u>Getting Started with JavaScript:</u></h3>
    <p>To get started with JavaScript, modern web browser is required. Recent versions of Firefox, Chrome, Microsoft Edge, and Safari all supports Javascripts.</p>
    <p>A very useful tool for exploring JavaScript is the JavaScript <b>Console</b> (sometimes called the Web Console, or just the console): this is a tool which enables you to enter JavaScript and run it in the current page.</p>
    <dl>
        <dt> <b>Method of Opening the Console in the Web Browser:</b></dt>
        <dd><ul><li>Ctrl + Shift + J</li></ul></dd>
        <dd><ul><li>Right click, and choose the <b>inspect</b> option in the browser</li></ul></dd>
    </dl>

    <h3><u>Conclusion:</u></h3>
    <p>JavaScript is often used alongside HTML and CSS to add interactivity to websites. In some cases, JavaScript may tap into third-party libraries to provide advanced functionality without the developer having to code it from scratch each time.</p>
    <p><em>JavaScript is beneficial in the following manners:</em></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Easy to learn and implement into certain web page elements or events</li>
        <li>Backed by a strong community of developers</li>
        <li>Reduces the requests sent to the server</li>
        <li>Compatible with many other languages</li>
        <li>Faster and more lightweight than other programming languages</li>
    </ul>

        <!-- do this exercises in the console -->
        <ul>
            <li>Use alert to display pop up of 'hello world, my journey of learning javascripts has begun'.</li>
            <li>Display your name in the pop up using alert</li>
            <li>Use math to calculate this simple arithmetic: 20 + 10 - 5</li>
            <li>Substract 60 from 100</li>
            <li>Use document.body.innerHTML to display 'hello world' on the page in the console.</li>
            <li>Display your name in the console</li>
            <li>Use document.body.innerHTML to make the page blank</li>
        </ul>
